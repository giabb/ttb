# TicTacBot - AIML 2.0 bot in Python

This project was developed as a support to my bachelor thesis in Computer Engineering supervised in 2018 by [Prof. Palmieri](https://www.mlsptlab-unicampania.it/people/faculty/francesco-a-n-palmieri.html). 

It is supposed to work only as a bot with [ProgramY](https://github.com/keiffster/program-y).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python3
- Ubuntu 18.04 or newer

### Installing

1. Install ProgramY ``` pip3 install programy ```
2. Copy the folder ```bots/tictacbot``` in ```/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/programy/```

## Testing the bot

Feel free to test the bot and edit it as you wish.

### End to end tests

1. Move to ```cd /.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/programy/bots/tictacbot/scripts/xnix```
2. Give permissions to the script ```chmod +x tictacbot.sh```
3. Execute the script ```./tictacbot.sh```
4. Talk to the bot

### Coding tests

If you want, you can edit the Python scripts in ``` /bots/tictacbot/scripts/xnix/ ``` to change the behaviour of the bot.

You will find the AIML files in ``` /bots/tictacbot/storage/ ```

Most of the code is in italian and I'm not planning to translate it since this is a discontinued project, sorry!
